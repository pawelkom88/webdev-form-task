## Attach you will find the index.html file that contains a standard form html and an jpg of the form you are looking to replicate. 

Your task is to style the current html to look like the form in the jpg. Do not worry about the form actually working for now I just want to see you basic html, css and javascript skills.

Things I am looking for:
<ol>
    <li> Add a field for a phone number and make sure it fits in with the rest of the form</li>
    <li> Link the privacy policy to and make it open into a new tab. Make sure the tickbox is required!</li>
    <li> Whoops, the text in the html is a bit of a mess! Make sure the code is neat and tidy. You donâ€™t need comments but as long as the tags line up well and not ridiulously spaced out.</li>
    <li> The submit button needs a hover effect. Make it hover however you like but make sure it fits the overall look and feel of the form</li>
    <li> If you can have the form appear after 5 seconds with an option to close/hide the form (i.e. a cross button to close it in the top right) (This is not necessary but would be cool to see if you can do it)</li>
</ol>
